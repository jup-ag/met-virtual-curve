## dynamic_bonding_curve [0.1.3] [PR #89](https://github.com/MeteoraAg/dynamic-bonding-curve/pull/89)
### Added
- Allow partner to config another mode for base fee, called rate limiter. With the mode is enable, fee slope will increase if user buy with higher amount. The rate limiter mode is only available if collect fee mode is in quote token only, and when user buy token (not sell). Rate limiter doesn't allow user to send multiple swap instructions (or CPI) to the same pool in 1 transaction

### Changed
- In base fee, we rename: `reduction_factor` to `third_factor`, `period_frequency` to `second_factor`, `number_of_period` to `first_factor`.
- Add a new field `base_fee_mode` in base fee state, that indicates whether the base fee is fee scheduler or rate limiter

### Breaking Changes
- Update max fee to 99%
- In swap instruction, if rate limiter is enable, user need to submit `instruction_sysvar_account` in remaining account, otherwise transaction will be failed
- Quote function can be changed by rate limiter and updated max fee

## dynamic_bonding_curve [0.1.2] [PR #87](https://github.com/MeteoraAg/dynamic-bonding-curve/pull/87)

### Added
- Add new endpoint `transfer_pool_creator` to allow pool creator to transfer to new creator
- When creating config, partner can specify the field `token_update_authority`. 0: creator can update token metadata, 1: creator can't update token metadata
- Allow partner to config migration fee, add new endpoint `withdraw_migration_fee`, so partner and creator can withdraw migration fee

### Changed
- Config state add a new field: `token_update_authority`, `migration_fee_percentage` and `creator_migration_fee_percentage` 


## dynamic_bonding_curve [0.1.1] [PR #71](https://github.com/MeteoraAg/dynamic-bonding-curve/pull/71)

### Added
- Allow more migrated fee options (4% and 6%)
- Allow partner to specify `creator_trading_fee_percentage` when creating config key. Trading fee and surplus will be shared between partner and creator.
